# Rocket training
This repository contains the scripts used in a game attempt made in [Unity](https://unity.com/es).

The objective of this project was to make a first contact with the engine to develop a simple game about the handling of a rocket or spacecraft so that it could be handled by means of programmed external code. It would then be an educational game dedicated to making players learn the basics of programming in a fun way.

The game would provide a series of levels with celestial bodies of different sizes and masses, which would affect the gravity and navigation of said rocket.

In each game cycle, the player's code would be called, sent the data of the state of the game and this would reply with the movements of the ship: angle and power. The player should take off, land, collect items, etc.

Attached to the repository are the python scripts that I used to make a ship that would detect its position with respect to the planets and their respective gravitational attractions in order to take off from a supposed Earth and land softly on a hypothetical Mars.
